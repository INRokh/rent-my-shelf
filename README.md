## Goal

The service that allows to run promotion campaigns in lightweight showrooms offered by space owners.

## Problem definition and solution

Many businesses such as shops and cafes require physical space. However, they rarely use space completely. Other businesses may be done online and donâ€™t require physical space per say, but can benefit from offline presence. For example, an online store may use local coffee shops to display their goods. Designers may promote their new collection in clothing shops.

The service allows online businesses to extend they promotion channels with clusters of lightweight offline showrooms. A promotion campaign may include dozens of such spaces covering target location and types of hosts. The key advantage is that starting a campaign is very easy and thus inexpensive.

Space owners, on the other hand, can get extra money without any effect on their core business.

## Major user scenarios 

The main user of the system is the party that wants to rent a space (shelf) for promotion referred as advertiser. The spaces are provided by another party referred as space owners or hosts. The main entity is a campaign. Advertisers run and pay for campaigns. Space owners host the camapigns and receive payments.

__Space(shelf)__ represent a physical space where products can be displayed. The space accommodates campaigns. Space can accommodate only one campaign at a time. Space includes detailed information and photos.

__Space category__ defines a type of the space, for example shops, cafes, bars etc.
